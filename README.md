# RSA-Algorithm
Encode and decodes text with the RSA Algorithm


The program first generates two random prime numbers with BigInteger, the size of the digit will be ask to the user, 
then calculates the module n = FirstPrime * SecondPrime (p*q), after that it calculates the toiltien {(p-1)*(q-1)} and the 
public and private keys.
At the end there's an option that allows to encode or decode with the given values (the ones we just calculated), there's
also a button that lets you chose a file as an input, or you can just type in something.
